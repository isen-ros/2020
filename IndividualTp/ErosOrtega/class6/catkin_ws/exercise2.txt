After purchasing a camera and pluggin in in the Raspberry pi, you'll have to set up the camera software (sudo raspi-config) and you'll have to select a camera in "interfacing options". Afterward you'll have to download some packages for the camara to work with ros, later you will launch the node for the camera, and afterwards you'll have to open the camera in a terminal to see what it detects.

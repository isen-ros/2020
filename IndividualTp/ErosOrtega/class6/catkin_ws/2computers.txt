If you want to run ros on 2 computers, they will have to on the same network. First of all you will have to setup the network you will need to set one of them as "master", later we'll have to configure a listener. This works for talker-lister programs. The way it works is that one computer acts as talker and another as listener. The steps for setting the network, setting the master and the listener can be easialy found online.

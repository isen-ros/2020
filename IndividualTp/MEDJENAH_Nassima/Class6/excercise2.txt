1) ADDING A CAMERA IN THE TURTLEBOT

To add a camera in our turtle bot burger, we have to use and connect a Raspberry Pi Camera Type G in our Raspberry.

Once it is done, we need to install some additional packages, which will permit us to see in the computer the view of the robot :

sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-image-transport ros-kinetic-cv-bridge ros-kinetic-vision-opencv python-opencv libopencv-dev ros-kinetic-image-proc

When the installation is complete, all we have to do to activate the camera is to launch the lines :

roslaunch turtlebot3_autorace_camera turtlebot3_autorace_camera_pi.launch
rqt_image_view

If everything does not works fine, the first thing to do is to calibrate the camera by using the line :

rosrun rqt_reconfigure rqt_reconfigure

We just need to click on the button "Camera" and ajust the parameter value.
We can do the same thing for the intrinsic camera calibration, and the extrinsic camera calibration. (All the code is in the ROS tutorials)

2) MAKE ROS WORKING IN 2 COMPUTERS

To deploy a ROS system across multiple machines, we first need to connect with each other thanks to ssh.
Then, we have to select one machine to run the master (roscore). If we imagine that we have 2 computers, A and B, we can for example choose A as the master and run "roscore".
 
Once it is done, we have to set the "ROS_MASTER_URI" which corresponds to the adresses of the computers. So in A we will have :

"export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://A:11311"

And in B we will write :

"export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://A:11311"

Now, we can launch a node in one computer and another in the other computer, and make communicate the 2 computers if the nodes are linked !
